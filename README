Example plugin for erlyvideo.

Add following line to erlmedia.conf out of virtual hosts:

{modules, [videoreader]}.

This line MUST be out of virtual hosts, because plugins must be started out of virtual hosts.
Clone videoreader into plugins folder of erlyvideo. 

After this restart erlyvideo and videoreader application should be started among others.

Next:

{ok, Pid} = videoreader:start_reader(Host, Name, Path).

Client will be started and will start to consume frames.
